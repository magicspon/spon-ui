  |
  | Screens in Tailwind are translated to CSS media queries. They define the
  | responsive breakpoints for your project. By default Tailwind takes a
  | "mobile first" approach, where each screen size represents a minimum
  | viewport width. Feel free to have as few or as many screens as you
  | want, naming them in whatever way you'd prefer for your project.
  |
  | Tailwind also allows for more complex screen definitions, which can be
  | useful in certain situations. Be sure to see the full responsive
  | documentation for a complete list of options.
